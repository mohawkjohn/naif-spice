This gem requires NAIF's CSPICE toolkit.  This can be downloaded from:
 http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit_C.html

To compile, you will need to go into the cspice/lib directory and copy cspice.a
to libcspice.a so that gcc can find it.  Then you will need to pass to extconf
the flag --with-cspice-dir=/path/to/cspice

Using the gem command, this might look like:
  gem install --local naif-spice.gem -- --with-spice-dir=/path/to/cspice

The CSPICE library is statically linked, do it doesn't matter where you
unarchive it for compiling.
